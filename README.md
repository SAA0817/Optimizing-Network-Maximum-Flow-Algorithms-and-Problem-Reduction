## Abstract  

</center>

Solving the network maximum flow problem is a significant combinatorial optimization problem and a hot research topic in graph theory. We first provide the relevant symbols and definitions for the maximum flow problem, then summarize previously proposed maximum flow algorithms and optimizations into two categories. We propose an improved method for the HLPP algorithm, test its performance, and evaluate its applicability. Finally, we introduce several types of problems that can be reduced to the maximum flow problem.  

In the maximum flow algorithm research section:  
- Classify algorithms into **augmenting path algorithms** and **preflow-push algorithms**  
- For augmenting path approaches:  
  ▪ Introduce EK/Dinic algorithms and their optimizations  
  ▪ Present MPM/ISAP variants with performance comparisons  
- For preflow-push approaches:  
  ▪ Analyze HLPP algorithm characteristics  
  ▪ Propose Budget Algorithm to mitigate "ping-pong effect"  
  ▪ Validate through comparative experiments  

We further summarize four problem reduction paradigms:  
1. Bipartite graph maximum matching  
2. Minimum-cost maximum flow  
3. Bipartite graph maximum weight matching  
4. Minimum cut problem  

All implementations are in C++ with comprehensive testing. Program source code is provided in the appendix.  

**Keywords:** **Network Maximum Flow**; **Dinic Algorithm**; **Highest Label Preflow Push Algorithm**; **Budget Algorithm**
